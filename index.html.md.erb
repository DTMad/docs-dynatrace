title: Dynatrace AppMon for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; Documentation
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This is documentation for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; [Dynatrace AppMon APM](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-dynatrace-appmon) tile.

The Dynatrace Application Monitoring (AppMon) service enables in-depth monitoring of applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), via an embedded agent bundled with applications that are deployed using Buildpacks. The service agent instruments the application by adding tracing and monitoring hooks to the code, then continuously sends the resulting data to AppMon account collectors. The AppMon account draws from this data to publish performance metrics and other details on the [dashboards](#views) of the Dynatrace AppMon Client Application.

### Dynatrace AppMon Service Broker

Cloud Foundry service brokers allow you to bind services to applications easily from the Pivotal Apps Manager Console or from the command line, so the applications can consume those services.

The Pivotal Cloud FoundryÂ® tile for Dynatrace AppMon installs the Dynatrace AppMon Service Broker as a Java application, registers it as a Service Broker on Cloud Foundry, and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. This simplifies the integration of Dynatrace AppMon services with Cloud Foundry applications.

## <a id="dependencies"></a> Packaging Dependencies

### Online Buildpacks

The Java Buildpack or other language buildpacks should have their proxy configuration enabled to download the agents if using online buildpacks. Offline buildpacks discussed below should not have this issue.

### Offline Buildpacks

If you are running PCF in an offline manner, you will want to be sure you have packaged the dependencies (including the Dynatrace AppMon agent sources) in your PCF environment.   
More details on this can be found here:  https://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/depend-pkg-offline.html Also, refer to next section on limitations around Buildpacks.

### Buildpack Limitations

The Dynatrace AppMon Agent is not currently bundled with any buildpacks available on PivNet (as of April 2016). Use the following supported Java and PHP buildpacks to pull the AppMon agent:

* Java Buildpack April 8, 2016 build commit # bed4c6137c7bf08c09813a4b5b33eed0d3eaee46 upwards

	* Use the latest online Java buildpack when pushing apps. Use `-b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack` or specify via manifest.

	* Create offline Java buildpack from latest github repository (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) and upload it to PCF.

* PHP Buildpack 4.0+

You can also bundle the Dynatrace AppMon Agent with the following Node.js Buildpack:

* Node.js Buildpack 1.5+ utilizing node engines 0.10.x and 0.12.x via agent bundling documented here: https://community.dynatrace.com/community/x/DafhCw

Future releases of Dynatrace AppMon for PCF will support other language buildpacks.
