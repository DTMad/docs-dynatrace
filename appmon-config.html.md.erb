This topic explains how to install Dynatrace Application Monitoring (AppMon) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) through a PCF service broker. Service brokers allow Cloud Foundry applications to bind to and consume the services from the Apps Manager console or command line.

The Pivotal Cloud FoundryÂ® (PCF) tile for Dynatrace AppMon installs the AppMon Service Broker as an application, registers it as a Service Broker on Cloud Foundry, and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.

3. Select a service plan and click **Select this plan**.
